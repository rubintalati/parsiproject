## PRE-WEDDING CEREMONIES

### Mandavsaro Ropvo and Kharaptu Karvu

In the past, when there were no baags people had to build mandvas for the wedding. Now as a sagan, this practice is still continued. As far as possible, this ceremony should be done in the morning. One can get from the gardner, a decorated pot with a mango branch. One can also get from a goldsmith sona-rupa-nu padiku. Otherwise, one can take out from a saree border, 3 tilis of gold and 4 of silver.

In one khumchi should be kept pan, sopari, kharek, badam, sakar a small glass of curds, a coconut, an egg, some wheat, rice, whole adad. Also a small, fresh, cleaned coconut with a little chotli and a ball of raw cotton thread (sutar dado), halad gathia, a fulyu of kanku and kharaptu. A new piece of mulmul (the size of a small handkerchief) should also be kept.

[How to make kharaptu:
1 tablespoon of rice flour, 1/2 teaspoon of halad powder and 1/4 teaspoon of kanku should be mixed in water to from a thick paste.]

Four sahovasans should get ready with tili and with heads covered with their sarees. For planting the mandav, if the Mobedsaheb is not there, a boy should be kept ready wearing a pagdee of red saree, a tili and a garland, (For this ceremony he should be given some cash as gift). The bride should also be ready with tili, garland and her head covered with her saree.

Now a rangoli should be done at the entrance of the house and a square crossed in the centre with kharaptu and small dots with kanku should be put on the wall. Now the pot should be kept on the rangoli, a pit dug in the middle of the earth in it and in this should be put kharek, pan, sopari, sakar, badam, rice, wheat, halad gathio, some curds, kanku, kharaptu, and sona-rupa, packet. (Some people put Rs. 1.25).

Then, while Mobedsaheb, or the boy who has been kept ready, puts in this pit the mango branch, reciting yatha ahuvairyo 7 times the 4 sahovasans keep their hands on the branch all the time. The earth should be well pressed and the branch planted.

Then ourna should be taken 7 times with the egg which is then broken and put in the mudpot. Similarly ovrna should be taken with the coconut 7 times which is then broken and its water poured on the mango branch, The mulmul piece, well-dipped in kharaptu should be put on the mango branch.

The coconut that has been cleaned should be decorated with kanku and then reciting yatha 7 times, it should be wrapped with raw cotton thread 7 times by one of the sahovasans (without a knot) and then it should be given in the hands of the bride.

### Supra-ni Reet

Now-a-days, this ceremony is not performed. But if desired, while preparing the mandav-no-thal, the supras should also be prepared.

Four new supras should be prepared at the hands of any sahovasan. On each of them, 5 tilis should be done, 3 of kharaptu and 2 of kanku. Then they should be wrapped 5 times with raw cotton thread without a knot. Each of them should be kept ready by placing in them wheat, rice, whole adad, sopari, 1 badam, 2 pieces of sakar, halad gathia and a piece of dry coconut.

Doing a tili to the iron khal (pounding pot) with kharaptu, it should be kept ready with 3 halad gathias in it. The same 4 sahovasans who had sown the mandavsaro, should hold the batto and crush the halad coarse.

(Some people do this ceremony before mandavsaro.)

### Aragh Vadherva-ni Reet

Making rangoli in the centre, khal should be put on it and then the 4 supras should be placed around it. From their supras each sahovasan should, put one piece of halad in the khal and all of them holding the batto together should crush the gathia coarse. After this, keeping the khal there only, the supru should be winnowed 5 times and then it should be exchanged with the supru of the sahovasan on the opposite side and it should again be winnowed 5 times. This way it should be exchanged 5 times.

The contents of the supras should be collected, kept aside and after varovar, should be put into the sea.

### Details about sending Poli-Batasa and furniture

The girl's parents should put 5 polis and 4 big batasas in the garlanded khumcho meant for this and send it to the daughter's sasre where it will remain as a sign of sagan. If the khumcho has not been purchased, cash should be sent for poli-batasa.

On the same day, all the furniture also should be sent, except the two wedding chairs, teapoy and lamp, which are to be taken to the baag. For the sake of convenience, a separate bag of clothes (like nightie and kimono), which will be required for changing soon after coming home from the baag, should also be packed separately and sent.

If the mandavsaro is done in the morning, the varni should be finished in the afternoon, so that in the baag, where there will be guests there won't be any confusion. If it cannot be done on the mandavsaro day, these things can be sent to the girl's sasre on the next day or the day after that.

### On the varni day Vaga-ni-Sés to be taken to the Jamai's house

In a new ses should be arranged the Jamai's sopara-no vago and with it adarni-nu watch, diva-na vaga-na buttons, gor-rupiya-na vaga na cash.

After applying kanku-kharaptu to all the tapelis, they should be put one above the other (one with pan-sopari should be at the top) and garlanded.

In another sés should be kept sasuji-no sopara-no vago, nanand-no vago, divo, adarni and gor rupiya-no vago.

(The girl wears this jewellery at the time of the wedding ceremony). After giving the jewellery and the clothes, she should be given diva-na, gor-rupiya-na, teda-na, pug-ni Janas-na- clothes or cash.

After the bride, the vevan should be given sopara-na kapda. She can keep these clothes by right.

Later, after keeping one rupee in the divo and after having snacks (mo mithu kari-ne) they should return home, taking their own ses.

### Khichdi-ni Reet and Varadh Pattar

Next day (second day) is the day for Khichdi-ni Reet i.e. the day of rest. On this day nothing much is done except ukurdi (where they used to play the game of ukurdi lutvi). Now-a-days, this custom is forgotton.

The day after this (i.e. the third day after the ceremonies start), is the day of varadh-pattar. At night, Ramyazad and Asho Faroharo are invited by praying the stoom and baj. Vardh-vada or Sagan-na cash should come from the boy's side (On the day of the wedding also, prayers are recited for Asho Faroharo and its explanation is given by the Mobedsaheb.)

### Bride on the stage for Ashirwad

After the bridegroom sits down, the girl's father should bring the bride to the stage. The girl's mother should do achumichu and then the girl should sit on the stage and her mother should stand behind her. She should be there to hold the sutarna-ata. Now the auspicious ceremony of ada antar should start. If too many people do not go on the stage the solemnity of the occasion will be maintained.

At the time of this ceremony, everyone should maintain silence. A mike may be kept on the stage so that guests can listen to the kalaam and respect peacefully this auspicious ceremony.

### Ceremonies to be performed after Ashirwad

After the Ashirwad Ceremony is over, the groom's father should garland the Mobedsaheb and give him the envelope.

Money should be carried to the baag for paying the electricity bill and the bandwala's bill.

Whatever clothes, jewellery and cash have been brought by the girl's in-laws, should be given to her and the groom.

### Things about Navjote to be explained to the child

What does Navjote signify? It is the "Beginning of taking up responsibility and leaving behind a carefree life. It Involves thanking the Almighty every day for his blessings. Every time while tying the knots of the kasti, you have to firmly resolve in your mind to observe with truth and purity, the message of "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" given by Paygambar Saheb. While putting on a spotlessly, white sadro, you have to take the vow of living an equally spotlessly clean life. You have to understand that just as merit cards are given in the school for good study, one makes a collection of 'savab (good deeds) in the gireban, depending on the deeds done daily. Greater the collection of savab, more beautiful is the prize one gets in life.

While tying the first knot of kasti, you must resolve, like a scout, to do some good work for the world, for God's sake, each day. While tying the second knot, you must resolve always to preserve the Zoroastrian religion with loyalty. While tying the third knot, you must resolve to fight against untruth, and for the victory of truth. While tying the fourth knot, you must resolve always to have faith in the Almighty, both in happiness and misery. You must remember that today, while wearing the kasti, you have agreed to observe 5 promises and they have to be observed throughout your life. The 5 promises are to preserve goodness, to preserve unity, to maintain peace and contentment with a clear conscience, to be generous in giving charity, and to be pure in body, mind and soul. From today onwards after the navjote these responsibilities have fallen on you and you should observe them with determination.

### Essence of Navjote

#### The Prayers

1. Jas Me Avanghahe: Oh Lord! Come to my help. I will worship the most enlightened lord and follow 'Zarthustra Saheb'. I agree to praise God Almighty and have faith in Him. I will praise all good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. I will praise the religion of Mazdayazni. My religion teaches me to preserve unity, to maintain peace, to do charity and to observe purity. Among all the religions that have been there in the past, and all those that will come in the future, I will consider my religion to be higher, better and more beautiful than all others. This religion has been sent by the Almighty and taught by 'Zarthustra Saheb'. I agree that all good blessings come from the Almighty. Let praise be to the religion of 'Mazdayazni'.

2. Ashem: Good purity is the highest blessing. That is real happiness. Only he gets real happiness who observes the path of purity for the sake of truth.

3. Yatha: Just as the Master of this world rules according to His wishes, similarly the head of religion, Paygambar Saheb, rules because of his purity. He who performs good deeds in this world for the sake of God, gets the reward of good mind. He who gives shelter to the poor and the helpless, gets power in the kingdom of God.

4. Kalmo: My religion is true, wise, good, sent by the Almighty, one that teaches purity, one that makes people worship One God. This religion was sent to this world by the Almighty and was brought by 'Zarthustra Saheb'. From today, I accept this religion.

## ESSENCE OF PARSI CEREMONIES

### The Essence of the Various Ceremonies Before the Wedding

a) *Dahi-Machli*: Butter and Ghee (which are both strength giving) are made from Dahi (curd) - so sagan is done with it. Similarly, just as a fish swims with ease in the water, we wish that the couple swim with ease in the ocean of life. *Boi* was used as it was easily available, but any other fish (chocolate of mava) can also be used.

b) *Sakar-Tapko*: *Sakar* is sent with the horoscope to make the new phase of the life sweet.

c) *Diva na Kapada*: Earlier both the bride and the groom used to light a lamp to signify light or brightness in the home and a *Rajmohar* was given to the servant as an act of charity. Now instead, we place a rupee coin in the *Diva*.

d) *Poli Patasha*: *Patasha* shows the sweetness in life. The outside white covering of the poli shows the clear clean mentality and the golden dal represents a clean smooth life.

e) *Tamba pad*: For setting up a new home- vessels are needed and may they always be full is indicated by putting wheat, *patasha-sev*, curd and a coconut in them.

Wheat indicates wealth.
Patasha indicates a sweet nature
Sev indicates a mixture of sweets and a coconut indicates a life useful in all aspects.

f) Tamba no kasiyo (copper bowl): The Hindus call their priest Gor. We give a bowl of copper with ghee and Jaggery as donation to the Mobed.

g) Madav Sara (The wedding canopy): Earlier the tent or canopy for the wedding was put up in front of the house. This required a hole to be dug to place the pole. The Spendarmad Amsaspand, who is the care taker of the soil needs to give his permission and we must put back what we have removed from the soil. So we put a small offering of metals Gold - Silver and copper. Then put loban and ask for a happy successful ceremony. The turmeric as per ayurvedic rules is good for health and beauty. The plant in the pot signifies a fruitful life.

h) Kharaptu: The two colours of Turmeric and kumkum are put in a design on the wall and all the doors - an indication of health and good behaviour.

i) Supra Uphanava (whinning): The whinning of the grain in the supra shows love and togetherness and pounding of the turmeric pods indicates that the bride is supposed to do housework.

j) Varni: It is a ceremony of give and take to show that the girl and boy like each other and that their parents and family are also happy to give their consent to the marriage.

k) Varadh Pattar:
Varadh means progress.
Pattar means letter.
This is a religious ceremony where the Yazads, Amsaspands and Faroharas are given a heavenly invitation to come and bless the couple. Big varadhvaras used to be distributed to show joy and happiness.

l) Ukardi: What was left after the prayer and distribution, was looted in a game of fun and frolic to show that the higher souls have been invited and remembered.

m) Pithi: This is a ceremony where turmeric is applied on the body of the bride and groom to enhance their health and beauty and to get them ready for the wedding.

n) Var Behdu: In this ceremony the bride's sister washes the hands and feet of the groom to show her respects to him and he in return gives her a gift and accepts her responsibility.

The above ceremonies do not pertain to our religion. In Iran there were no such ceremonies, but due to the promise given to Jadi Rana we have adopted the Hindu ceremonies and various changes have taken place in them over the years.

The *kumkum* on the forehead, the glass bangles, *sés* etc. is not of Iranian origin, but it shows the Parsee character of tolerance, co-operation, friendliness and the honour 'to keep the promise to the ruler of the land.

We therefore, continue to follow these ceremonies and hope that they are followed as far as possible by all Parsees.
