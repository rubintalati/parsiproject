# Zoroastrian Death Rituals: A Comprehensive Guide

---

## 1. The Nature and Philosophy of Death

Zoroastrianism teaches that every human is mortal, and death is a transformation for the soul—not total annihilation. The physical body is transmuted from one form to another, as the soul departs for the spiritual realm. Death is seen as a temporary triumph of evil, but ultimately, it is a necessary and inevitable part of God’s plan. Unnatural and untimely death is viewed as the work of evil, but in the broader context, death is a certainty for all.

## 2. The Soul and Divine Justice

A human being is composed of physical, astral, and spiritual constituents. At death, these separate:
- The physical decomposes and must be disposed of properly
- The astral takes time to return to the elements
- The immortal spiritual constituents return to their respective stations

The soul remains in the material world for three days and nights after death, in the care of the divine being Sraosha. Rituals performed during this period ensure the soul’s safe passage to the spiritual world.

## 3. Necessity and Purpose of After-Death Rituals

- **For the soul:**
  - Rituals help the soul reach its station in the spiritual world by the dawn of the fourth day (Chahrom)
  - Later rituals console and support the soul, encouraging its journey towards Garothman (the highest heaven)
  - Prayers and rituals do not alter the soul’s karmic balance or place in the afterlife; only deeds in the material world matter
- **For the living:**
  - Rituals serve as a balm, helping the bereaved cope with loss and fulfill their obligations to the departed

- Rituals comfort the living and help them fulfill their obligations

## 7. Rules and Decorum at Funerals

- Strict rules ensure the seclusion and safe handling of the body (Sachkār, Sagdid)
- Mourners walk in pairs, connected by a handkerchief, behind the corpse to minimize the risk from druj-i-nasu
- Baj of Sarosh is recited for protection
- Kasti is performed before and after visiting Doongerwadi
- Non-Parsis are not allowed to attend or view the body after Sachkār, as their presence vitiates the power of the prayers
- Only Khandias and Nasesalars (ritually prepared corpse-bearers) may handle the body after Sachkār

## 8. Ritual Details and Etiquette

- Mourners should maintain decorum, avoid needless talking, and focus on prayers
- Specific prayers are recommended at various stages (Geh-sārnā, Pāy-dast, Uthamna)
- Rose petals and rose water are distributed after Uthamna, and mourners are encouraged to pledge good deeds or charity in memory of the deceased

## 9. Special Rituals and Concepts

## 10. The Dokhmenashini System

- Dokhmenashini is the process of exposing the corpse in a ritually prepared Dakhma, to the sun and birds of prey
- Based on four principles: disposal away from habitation, on an elevated place, exposed to the sun, and to birds of prey
- Considered the most ecological and spiritual method for Zoroastrians
- Ensures speedy release of the soul and semi-spiritual constituents
- Cremation and burial are discouraged as they pollute natural elements and slow down the soul’s evolution

## 11. The Sagdi at Doongerwadi

- The Sagdi is a building at Doongerwadi housing an unconsecrated Dadgah fire
- Zoroastrians are encouraged to offer prayers and sandalwood at the Sagdi after funerals
- The Sagdi is not a consecrated fire, so it cannot be desecrated by mourners

## 12. The Tower of Silence (Dakhma): Structure, Practice, and Modern Challenges

A Tower of Silence (Dakhma) is a raised, circular structure used for funerary purposes by Zoroastrians. The practice involves exposing the corpse to the sun and vultures, in accordance with the belief that the four elements—fire, water, earth, and air—are sacred and must not be polluted by the dead.

### Historical and Religious Rationale
- The exposure of corpses to scavenging animals dates back to at least the 5th century BCE, as recorded by Herodotus, and possibly earlier.
- Cremation is avoided to prevent pollution of fire and air; burial is avoided to protect earth and groundwater.
- The English term "Tower of Silence" was coined in the 19th century by Robert Murphy, a British colonial translator.

### Structure and Arrangement
- The Dakhma consists of three concentric circles:
  - Outer circle: men
  - Middle circle: women
  - Inner circle: children
- Bodies are arranged accordingly, and the flesh is consumed by vultures, often within half an hour if the vulture population is healthy.
- After defleshing, bones are left to dry and bleach in the sun, considered a purification process.
- Skeletal remains are then either placed in an ossuary or a central well, where they eventually disintegrate into powder.

### Modern Usage and Challenges
- Towers of Silence are still found in Iran and India, especially in Mumbai, which has a large Parsi population.
- In Iran, the practice was banned in the 1970s, leaving many Dakhmas disused.
- In India, the decline of vulture populations due to the use of Diclofenac in livestock has posed a challenge for this funerary custom.
- Some Parsi communities have adopted burial or cremation, while others have constructed aviaries to breed and sustain vulture populations near the Dakhmas.

### Symbolism and Environmental Wisdom
- The Dakhma system reflects the Zoroastrian reverence for nature and ecological responsibility.
- It is designed to avoid polluting the sacred elements and to return the body to nature in the most harmless way possible.
